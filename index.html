<p>A lot about Copiosis can be found at <a href="http://copiosis.com">the Copiosis website</a> including our <a href="http://copiosis.com/creating-utopia/">transition plan</a> and a post describing generally <a href="http://copiosis.com/how-do-you-pay-for-all-this-2/">how the system works</a>. Our innovation is gaining momentum and traction, as more people around the world are becoming interested in our work. Two of our eight real-world demonstration projects have launched. The eight includes projects being planned in Spain and the UK. So we already have international progress even though we’re only two years old.</p>

<p>As our system operates on open source software, we’ve created this project site to manage further software development. The initial application was created by Computer Science Capstone program at Portland State University. We are very grateful for their massive contribution. This initial version provides the basic features needed to run demonstration projects in Portland, Oregon, Chico, California and other locations as they come online. As expected, with the launch of our first two demonstration projects, it is already clear that more development work is needed to add more features. Some of these features we expected we’d need, and some we didn’t expect. We’re inviting developers to participate in this work.</p>

<p>In addition to software development, we also require people who have excellent math skills to help refine our system algorithm. The algorithm is used by our innovation to award the “points” people receive when they make people and the planet better off. The algorithm also is open source and we invite anyone with skills in math to make the algorithm better.</p>

<p>This is our first effort at engaging with the world in evolving our software and the algorithm. Please bear with us as we improve our pages and repository organization. More details to come!</p>
